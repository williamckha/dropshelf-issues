- Select the language you'd like to translate for under the Dashboard tab. The website will help guide you through the translation process.
- If you want to add a new language, please create a new discussion on the Crowdin project and I'll be happy to add your language to the list of supported languages.
- Your translations will automatically be synchronized with Dropshelf's codebase and will be released in the next app update.
